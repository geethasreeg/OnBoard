The Weather Station

My board is a prototype for a weather station, which I'm building for the trail. It detects chnages in weather and humidity.
Estimated cost - $8

I read some articles and books, so I initially struggled to form a complete plan, BUT later, I did and posted it in #scrapbook on Slack! **
